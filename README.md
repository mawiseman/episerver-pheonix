## Things that might be cool
- Unicorn for dev content
- LanguageFiles transforms for features
  - Language files are stored here \Resources\LanguageFiles\ (EditorHints.xml for editor hints)
  - How can either... 
    - combine xml files from features on build
    - or: change the system that loads values to look in multiple locations
