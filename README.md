## Introduction

This is a project that i ahve been putting together whilst going through the EPI Server developers training and is a proving ground for what i am learning as well as some structures / processes which future projects might use

## Todo
- 404
- 500
- Robots
- Dictionary (or do we just use language files)
- Default Devices

## Useful links
- Fontawesome thumbnails: https://github.com/Geta/Epi.FontThumbnail
  - i like this more than my ImageUrlGenerator
- 404 and redirect manager: https://github.com/Geta/404handler
- Sitemap: https://github.com/Geta/SEO.Sitemaps

## Things that might be cool
- Unicorn for dev content
- LanguageFiles transforms for features
  - Language files are stored here \Resources\LanguageFiles\ (EditorHints.xml for editor hints)
  - How can either... 
    - combine xml files from features on build
    - or: change the system that loads values to look in multiple locations
